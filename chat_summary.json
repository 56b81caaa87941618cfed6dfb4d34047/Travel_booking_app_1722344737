The AI acknowledges the user's requests and offers options to fine-tune the details. Initially, the AI commits to reducing text size and enriching content. It then presents a list of potential features, such as adding a search bar, a 'Popular Destinations' carousel, a countdown timer for offers, and a 'Recent Reviews' section. Questions are posed regarding the new title/CTA's focus and the font's size and style preference. The user expresses a desire to replace the top hero section with a more detailed title/CTA, leading to the AI suggesting a large SVG of an airplane, accompanied by a variety of related features including animated effects and dynamic weather updates. Following this, the user seeks to enhance the top navigation with a beautiful purple theme and modernized login buttons, alongside implementing a comprehensive footer section also themed in purple. The user further requests the integration of a detailed customer support ticket submission form, shaded in purple, and seeks advice on the design and functionality of various sections, including the call to action and the testimonial section. The AI confirms working on these updates, emphasizing the adoption of a visually consistent purple color scheme, modern card designs, and a strategically placed 'Book Now' button to enhance user engagement and conversion.",
