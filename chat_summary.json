Additionally, the user inquired about options for a dynamic or static list of crypto projects, and whether the \"auto-stake\" feature should rebalance stakes or make a one-time selection.\n\nFor a separate project, the user wanted the implementation of a node operator onboarding section with wallet connectivity, staking for the $SXT token, and a public key submission field. They also requested the replacement of a section with an interactive SVG of a cat and details on its implementation, alongside customer-centric features such as a comprehensive search functionality for travel, dynamic background changes, and user review integrations.\n\nAnother task involved designing a hero section with a large call to action and testimonials for a plane booking service, including a detailed top navigation with placeholder content and login buttons. For customer support requests, the user opted for a bright purple theme with a detailed submission form and wrapped existing feature sections in beautiful purple-shaded containers.\n\nLastly, the user sought to revamp the hero section of a webpage with a new design that incorporated a top call to action, a bottom testimonial section, a bright purple theme, rounded/beveled edges, and asked for a description of the project for further assistance.",
